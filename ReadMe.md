## Overview

A plugin based Blazor based blogging platform that is really easy to create plugins for or customise. 

The platform is build with Razor Class Libraries and Razor Components and has a plugin system build around these features which makes it easy to create plugins to extend / customise almost all areas of the Blog using Blazor. Front end is using Bootstrap V5 (But you could use what you want) and the backend/admin is built using MudBlazor.

#### What This Is Not

A fully working blogging engine and ready for production. This is a work in progress and I'm still trying to get it to a beta stage. I'm posting this publicly as I'm looking for other Blazor enthusiasts to get involved and help shape the project further.

### Progress

Right now, the plugin system is taking shape, everything you see is 'pluggable'. From the content items on a post, to the post preview, settings the works, the admin section itself. 

It's very simple right now, it has no authentication, and is just a simple front end that lists the posts made, and you can view an individual post. A post has content items, each of those is a plugin, and has a ContentPlugin to render on the front end. If you look at the code it should make sense, or read below in the plugin section.

To get it running, just make sure BlogFodder.App is set as the Start Up project, and you have restored all the nuget packages.

### Current Plugins

The final concept will be users can create Nuget packages that just reference the `BlogFodder.Plugins` project/nuget package (When the nuget package is created). That's it. Oh, also, all plugins Namespaces must start with BlogFodder.Plugins.XX (Again, all this is subject to change)

The two main plugins are:

#### IPlugin

This is main plugin system for the blog. This allows you to render components in [specific places,](https://github.com/YodasMyDad/BlogFodder/blob/master/BlogFodder.Core/Plugins/Models/PluginDisplayArea.cs) have a settings page in the admin and also display a component on a post.

I have created (very rough) example Plugin, called **Comments**, a plugin that allows you to add comments on posts, manage them, approve and more. 

https://github.com/YodasMyDad/BlogFodder/tree/master/BlogFodder.Plugins/Comments

Plugins have to be enabled first before they appear on the site.

#### IEditorPlugin

This controls the content editors, which are how the user can edit content and how it is previewed in the admin section, settings and how it is rendered in the front end (Also global settings). 

The concept for the blog, is instead of having just a single RTE or Markdown Editor. Each block of content can be it's own editor and preview. 

The two implementations of this are **`MarkdownEditorEditorPlugin`** and **`RichTextEditorEditorPlugin`**, so check those out below if you want to know more about how to use them.

Some ideas for other editors for the future would be:

- Image Carousel Editor (Standard Carousel that slides but with options)
- Image Gallery Editor (Which options for layout)
- YouTube Video Editor (Insert YouTube Videos)
- Image Generator Editor (Use DALL-E to create AI images from text prompt)
- Embed Tweet Editor (Allows you to paste a tweet URL and displays it on the front end)
- Code Editor (Code editor like ACE that allows you to edit the code and highlights it correctly on the front end)
- ChatGPT Editor (Uses TinyMCE or similar to allow you to create content)
- Amazon Affiliate Editor (Allows you to select products and create comparison tables with affiliate links)

You can view the current Editor plugins here

**Then we have other ways to extend the platform with the following**

#### IBackOfficeNavigationItem

This just controls a link being added to a section in the admin navigation, can be a class, or a Blazor Page can inherit from the Interface.

If you are making a section in the admin with a number of pages, it's easier to just add a class, like I have done with the `PostNavigation.cs` for the Posts section in the admin. If it's just a single page, then it's probably easier to just Implement on the Razor component directly.

You can choose which section to add the link to and also add new sections of links by updating the appSettings and then adding your new section in your 

```json
"BackOffice": {
  "CustomNavigationSections": [
    "Custom"
  ]
}
```

#### IStorageProvider

You can create your own Storage provider for saving files. The app comes with the default `DiskStorageProvider` which stores all files to disk. 

https://github.com/YodasMyDad/BlogFodder/blob/master/BlogFodder.Core/Providers/DiskStorageProvider.cs

But you can implement your own version to use say Azure Blob storage. Then you just need to update the `appSettings` to use your version i.e.

`"IStorageProvider": "BlogFodder.Plugins.CustomProviders.AzureStorageProvider"`

#### IExternalAuthenticationProvider

While the login/authentication hasn't been hooked up yet, the site is using .Net Identity as the authentication provider, but will only allow login via external providers. This was all the password management can be handled by the providers.

You can add External Authentication providers by Implementing the `IExternalAuthenticationProvider`. The site will launch with 3 existing providers already created which are Facebook, Google & Microsoft. You can see the code for these providers in `BlogFodder.Plugins` project

https://github.com/YodasMyDad/BlogFodder/tree/master/BlogFodder.Plugins/Authentication

#### IStartUpPlugin

Allows you to add services during startup, example of using this in the Comments plugin

https://github.com/YodasMyDad/BlogFodder/blob/master/BlogFodder.Plugins/Comments/PostCommentsStartup.cs

#### IRenderPlugin

***Coming soon*.**... This plugin will be executed in middleware and will allow you to manipulate the final HTML of the page before it gets to the user.

Some ideas for this will be replace keys in the content, for example, you have have something `#Year#` in the content and that is replaced with the current year **2023**

#### Theme Customisation

I've gone with a different route with the theme engine, all the components that make up the front end are in the `appSettings`. So if you want to override/restyle the front end, you just need to create your own versions of the components and point to them in the `appSettings`.

For example, lets saying you wanted to customise the Header either by adding a new feature or changing the styling. Just create your own Header component, by copying the existing one. Then in the `appSettings` point the site to your version of the `Header` component

`"HeaderComponent": "BlogFodder.Plugins.MyCustomProject.FrontEnd.Header"`

This way you can completely customise and update the site without touching the core code.

https://github.com/YodasMyDad/BlogFodder/blob/master/BlogFodder.App/appsettings.json#L71

### Entity Framework

To update and make changes to the EF Core model, the migrations are in the .Core project. Migrations are auto applied at startup in the Program.cs.

```
dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef

cd BlogFodder.Core
dotnet ef --startup-project ../BlogFodder.App/ migrations add NameOfMigrationHere -o "Data/Migrations"

// Optional - as migrations are run on startup  
dotnet ef database update --context BlogFodderDbContext
```

### Calling Experienced OSS .Net & Blazor Fans

I am looking to create a small team, of folk much smarter than me to help me move/shape this POC/idea into something people can use. I have lot's of ideas for concepts and how things might work, It would seem I'm just not a good enough developer to put these all in action.
